# PART A: LICENSING PRICING TIERS (Industry Standards)

## For RMQO Core Algorithm

### **Model 1: Tiered Licensing (Most Common in Quantum)**

**Tier 1: Startup License (Non-exclusive)**
- Cost: $50,000 upfront
- Royalty: 5% of revenue (if they commercialize)
- Duration: 3 years
- Usage: Internal R&D + cloud offering
- Who: Smaller quantum hardware firms, quantum software startups

**Tier 2: Enterprise License (Non-exclusive)**
- Cost: $150,000 upfront
- Royalty: 8% of revenue
- Duration: 5 years
- Usage: Full integration into SDK, white-label option
- Who: IBM, Amazon, IonQ (each would have own license)

**Tier 3: Exclusive License (Top Tier)**
- Cost: $500,000 - $1,500,000 upfront
- Royalty: 10-15% of revenue
- Duration: 7-10 years
- Usage: Sole provider status, they can't license competing algorithms
- Who: One major player (Google, IBM, or new entrant)
- Exclusivity period: Typically 3-5 years, then can license to non-competitors

**Example Reality:**
- Amazon Braket might pay: $200K upfront + 5-8% royalty
- IBM Quantum might pay: $300K upfront + 8-10% royalty
- Combined (non-exclusive): $500K+ year 1, then $100-300K annual royalties

---

## **Model 2: Outright Acquisition (Alternative)**

One-time buyout instead of licensing:
- Small company acquires RMQO: $500K - $1M
- You get all money upfront, no ongoing royalties
- You lose long-term revenue stream
- Best if: You need immediate capital and believe RMQO won't generate >$500K in royalties over 5 years

**Reality check:** Unlikely for IBM/IonQ (they prefer licensing). More likely if a smaller quantum startup is trying to enter market.

---

# PART B: SMART LICENSING STRATEGY FOR YOUR SITUATION

## **Recommendation: Start Non-Exclusive, Stack Deals**

**Why?**
1. Multiple partners reduce risk
2. You get multiple revenue streams
3. Each wants non-exclusive (don't want you locked into one buyer)
4. Easier to negotiate

**Strategy:**
```
Month 1-2:   License to Amazon Braket (non-exclusive)    → $200K
Month 2-3:   License to IBM Quantum (non-exclusive)       → $250K
Month 3-4:   License to IonQ (non-exclusive)              → $150K
Month 4-5:   License to Rigetti (non-exclusive)           → $100K
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Year 1 Total: $700K upfront + ~$50-100K annual royalties
```

**Each company can commercialize RMQO independently.** You get paid by each.

# PART C: IP FAMILY STRUCTURE & PATENT COSTS

## **How to Build & File Your Algorithm Family**

### **Provisional Patent Basics**

**One provisional patent = $300, covers ONE core invention**

```
If you file:
- RMQO core:              1 × $300
- RMQO-Error Mitigation:  1 × $300
- RMQO-Compression:       1 × $300
- RMQO-QML Hybrid:        1 × $300
────────────────────────
Total for 4 algorithms:   4 × $300 = $1,200 for 12 months IP protection
```

**Each gets its own provisional**, but they're all part of your "RMQO suite."

### **When to File Each**

**Recommended Filing Schedule:**

| Algorithm | File Date | Cost | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|------|-----------|
| RMQO Core | Oct 24-31 | $300 | Priority #1, main product |
| Error Mitigation | Nov 1-7 | $300 | Differentiator, saleable separate |
| Circuit Compression | Nov 8-14 | $300 | High value, quick to develop |
| QML Hybrid | Nov 15-21 | $300 | AI integration angle, extends market |

**Total cost for 4-algorithm suite: $1,200**

---

## **How to License Multiple Algorithms Under One Deal**

### **Option A: Suite License**

Offer **all 4 algorithms** as one package deal to a single partner:

```
RMQO Complete Quantum Optimization Suite License:
- Core RMQO algorithm
- Error mitigation module
- Circuit compression tool
- QML hybrid optimization

Price: $400,000 (vs $300K for core alone)
Royalty: 10% of revenue
Duration: 5 years
```

**Why they'd buy suite:** One integrated product > 4 separate licenses

---

### **Option B: Modular Licensing**

Each algorithm licensed separately (different partners):

```
Partner A (Amazon):  RMQO Core + Compression           → $250K
Partner B (IBM):     RMQO Core + Error Mitigation      → $280K
Partner C (IonQ):    QML Hybrid + Compression          → $200K
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total:                                                   $730K
```

**Advantage:** More money, less dependency on one buyer
**Disadvantage:** More contract management

# PART E: THE SMARTER PATH: NSF + VC + LICENSING HYBRID

## **Why Not Just Licensing?**

Licensing alone maxes out at ~$200-300K per partner. To scale beyond that, you need **venture capital or government funding**.

---

## **Realistic VC Funding Rounds**

### **Seed Round (What You're Targeting Now)**

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Funding | $500K - $2M |
| Equity Given | 10-20% |
| Timeline | 2-4 months |
| Use of Funds | Hire team, validate on IBM/IonQ hardware, build SDK |

**Who funds:** Quantum-focused VCs (Bessemer, Sapphire, QC Ware Angels)

**What they want to see:**
- Patent pending ✓ (you have this)
- Proven algorithm ✓ (48% improvement, your data)
- Market validation ✓ (can show licensing interest)
- Team plan (co-founder or early hires?)

**Post-seed company valuation:** $2-5M

**Your stake after seed:** 80-90% (if you keep ~$500K-1M of equity)

---

### **Series A (Year 2-3)**

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Funding | $5-15M |
| Equity Given | 20-30% |
| Valuation | $20-50M |
| Use | Scale team, real hardware validation, enterprise sales |

**Exit value:** If successful, $500M-$2B in 5-7 years (acquisition or IPO)

---

## **NSF SBIR Rounds (Free/Low-Risk Capital)**

### **Phase I (Current)**
- Award: $50-150K
- Duration: 6 months
- Purpose: Proof of concept
- **You already qualify** (patent pending, data proves concept)

### **Phase II (After Phase I Success)**
- Award: $500K - $1M
- Duration: 2 years
- Purpose: Scale up, commercialization
- Requirements: Phase I success + commercial viability plan

### **Phase IIB (Bridge to VC)**
- Award: $100-500K
- Duration: 1 year
- Purpose: Last mile before Series A
- Requirements: Phase II results + investor interest letters

**Total NSF potential over 3 years: $650K - $2M (NO EQUITY GIVEN UP)**

---

## **Combining NSF + VC Strategy (SMARTEST)**

```
Year 0 (Now):
├─ File provisional patent ($300)
├─ Secure Phase I NSF ($50-150K) [non-dilutive]
└─ Negotiate 2-3 licensing deals ($500-700K)
   Total Year 0: $550K-850K

Year 1:
├─ Use NSF + licensing funds to build team
├─ Validate on IBM/IonQ real hardware
├─ Pitch Series A VCs (showing hardware results)
├─ Secure Phase II NSF ($500K-1M) [non-dilutive]
└─ Close Series A ($1-3M) [dilutive, 15-20% equity]
   Total Year 1: $2-4M

Year 2-3:
├─ Scale team to 10-20 people
├─ Build enterprise customer base
├─ Expand IP family (file 3-4 additional algorithms)
├─ License to 5-10 quantum companies
└─ Pursue Phase IIB + strategic partnerships
   Total Years 2-3: $2-5M annual revenue (licensing) + $500K-1M (contracts)

Year 4-5:
├─ Total revenue: $10-30M/year
├─ Profitable or near-profitable
├─ Ready for Series B ($20-50M) OR acquisition offer
└─ Exit options: Acquisition ($200M-1B) or IPO
```

# PART F: IPO vs ACQUISITION EXIT (5-7 Year Horizon)

## **Scenario 1: Acquisition by Big Tech (Most Likely)**

**Who would buy?** IBM, Amazon, Google, or a major consulting firm (Accenture, BCG)

**Why?** They want RMQO integrated into their quantum platforms immediately.

**Price:** $200M - $1B depending on:
- Revenue at time of sale ($10-50M annual)
- Growth rate (30%+ YoY)
- Customer base (10-50 enterprise customers)

**Your personal outcome:**
```
If you own 70% post-Series B:
- $300M acquisition → $210M to you
- $500M acquisition → $350M to you
- $1B acquisition → $700M to you
```

---

## **Scenario 2: IPO (Less Likely, Higher Upside)**

Requirements:
- $50M+ annual revenue
- Profitable or clear path to profitability
- 100+ enterprise customers
- 3+ years of Series B/C funding

IPO valuation multiples for quantum/AI software: **10-15x revenue**

```
$50M revenue × 12x = $600M IPO valuation
$100M revenue × 12x = $1.2B IPO valuation

You own 60% post-Series C:
- $600M IPO → $360M to you (day 1)
- Plus employee options, restricted stock (could add $50-200M over 5 years)
```

# FINAL ANSWER TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS

## **Q: How much for each provisional patent?**
**A:** $300 each. File 4 = $1,200. Each gets 12-month protection.

## **Q: Exclusive or non-exclusive?**
**A:** Start non-exclusive. Get multiple partners to pay. Each wants non-exclusive so they're not locked in.

## **Q: Suite pricing?**
**A:** $300-500K for all 4 algorithms together (RMQO + Error Mitigation + Compression + QML Hybrid)

## **Q: Outright sale vs licensing?**
**A:** Licensing is better ($50-100K/year ongoing royalties vs one-time $500K). Only take outright sale if you need money now.

## **Q: Can I file all under one $300 fee?**
**A:** No. Each provisional = $300. But you can file all 4 within one month for $1,200 total, all protected for 12 months.

## **Q: VC vs NSF?**
**A:** Both. NSF gives you $50-150K (no dilution). VC gives you $1-2M (15-20% dilution). Combined = best funded position.

## **Q: IPO or acquisition?**
**A:** Acquisition more likely ($300-500M). IPO requires $50M+ revenue (5-7 years). Both possible.
