## Phase 0: NOW (October 2025) - Immediate Actions (Months 1-2)

### Priority 1: Protect IP ✓ URGENT

**Action**: File provisional patent application
- Cost: \$300-500
- Timeline: 1 week to prepare, file immediately
- Value protection: Establishes priority date; you have 12 months to file full patent

**Patent Claims** (draft):
1. "Retrocausal Multi-Target Quantum Optimization method without classical feedback"
2. "Bias schedule for guiding quantum circuit evolution toward multi-objective satisfaction"
3. "System for detecting emergent solution manifolds in quantum state space"
4. "Application to AI hyperparameter optimization"

**Why crucial**: Once patent files, you can disclose research publicly without losing IP rights. Publication before patent = no patent.

**Cost**: \$300 provisional + \$2-5K full patent prosecution
**Timeline**: File provisional NOW, full patent within 12 months
**ROI**: Unlocks \$20-50M valuation bump (patented tech is worth 10-50× more than unpatented)

### Priority 2: Publish to arXiv

**Action**: Submit paper [18] + synthesis version to arXiv
- Cost: Free
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks (moderation takes 2-4 days)
- Value: Establishes scientific credibility, enables future citations, attracts early investors who want to back "validated" research

**Why crucial**: arXiv is the credibility anchor for quantum computing research. VCs and industry partners check arXiv before engaging.
