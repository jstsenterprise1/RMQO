# PART 1: PATENT STRATEGY (The IP Foundation)

## Provisional Patent: The Smart First Move

### **What is a Provisional Patent?**

A provisional patent is a **temporary patent application** that:
- Costs only $300 (vs $5,000+ for full patent)
- Takes 1-2 weeks to file (vs 6-12 months for full)
- Lasts 12 months
- Establishes "priority date" (proves you invented it first)
- Allows you to say "Patent Pending"

### **Why File Provisional FIRST (Not Full Patent)**

**Timeline:**
```
Oct 24:        File provisional patent ($300)
Oct 24-31:     Publish on arXiv (protects prior art)
Nov 1-30:      Approach investors/partners
Jan 24 (month 3): Decide if full patent worth it
```

**Cost-Benefit:**
- Provisional: $300, gives you 12-month window
- Full patent: $5-15K (attorney fees)
- Only file full if you have revenue or funding

### **How to File Provisional Patent**

**Step 1: Prepare Your Disclosure (DIY, $0)**

Write a document covering:
```
1. TITLE: "Retrocausal Multi-Target Quantum Optimization (RMQO) Algorithm"

2. SUMMARY:
   - What problem does it solve?
   - How is it different from QAOA/VQE?
   - What's the 48% improvement vs baseline?

3. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   - Circuit structure (H gates, CNOT gates, RZ gates)
   - Bias annealing schedule (0 → 0.7)
   - Multi-objective coherence
   - Measurement and evaluation

4. CLAIMS (What's actually patentable):
   - Claim 1: "Method for quantum optimization without classical feedback"
   - Claim 2: "System for multi-objective coherence discovery"
   - Claim 3: "Bias annealing schedule for retrocausal guidance"
   - Claim 4: "Application to AI model hyperparameter optimization"

5. DRAWINGS (Optional):
   - Circuit diagram showing gates
   - Energy convergence curves
   - Comparison to QAOA

6. REFERENCES:
   - Your data files (CSV)
   - Your code (GitHub)
   - Your arXiv paper
```

**Step 2: File with USPTO (Online, $300)**

```
Go to: https://www.uspto.gov/patents/apply
- Create account
- Select "Provisional Application"
- Upload disclosure document
- Pay $300 filing fee
- Done! You have priority date.
```

**Step 3: Now You Can Publish Freely**

Once provisional filed:
- ✓ Post on arXiv
- ✓ Talk about it publicly
- ✓ Approach investors
- ✓ Won't lose patent rights

---

## Full Patent: Conditional on Revenue

**Decision point (Month 12, 12 weeks before expiration):**

- **If you have revenue or funding**: File full patent ($5-15K)
- **If not**: Let provisional expire, file on arXiv forever

**Timeline for full patent:**
- Cost: $5-15K (attorney fees)
- Time: 18-36 months for approval
- Value: Legally enforceable worldwide

**Pro tip**: File provisional, see if you can sell it or get funded FIRST. No point paying $10K for full patent if no one wants to buy it.

---

# PART 2: LICENSING (Fastest Path to Revenue)

## What is Licensing?

**Licensing** = You let someone else use your patent/algorithm in exchange for royalties or upfront fees.

### **Model 1: Upfront Licensing Deal (FASTEST)**

**Who to approach:** IBM, Amazon, Google Quantum, IonQ, D-Wave

**Deal structure:**
- They pay you $50-500K upfront
- You give them non-exclusive license to RMQO
- They can integrate into their cloud platforms
- You get 5-15% royalty on their quantum computing revenue

**Expected numbers:**
```
IBM Quantum licensing deal:
- Upfront: $250K
- Royalty: 10% of quantum API revenue
- IBM quantum revenue: ~$100M annually (in 5 years)
- Your annual cut: ~$10M (if dominant algorithm)
```

**Timeline to deal: 2-4 months**

### **Model 2: Consulting/Integration Fee (MEDIUM SPEED)**

**Who to approach:** Major quantum consultancies (Boston Consulting Group, Accenture)

**Deal structure:**
- Hire you as consultant: $200-500/hour
- You integrate RMQO into their quantum optimization services
- You get 3-10% of each consulting project revenue

**Expected numbers:**
```
- Consulting rate: $300/hour
- Hours per project: 100-200
- Revenue per project: $30-60K
- Your cut (10%): $3-6K per project
- Projects per year: 5-10
- Annual revenue: $15-60K
```

**Timeline to first project: 1-2 months**

### **Model 3: SaaS Licensing (LONG-TERM, HIGHEST POTENTIAL)**

**What it means:** Offer RMQO as a cloud service customers pay monthly for.

**Business model:**
```
Tier 1 (Startup): $99/month → 100-qubit-hour quota
Tier 2 (Enterprise): $999/month → 1000-qubit-hour quota
Tier 3 (Custom): $9,999/month → unlimited + support
```

**Expected numbers:**
```
Year 1: 10 customers × $500/month avg = $60K annual revenue
Year 2: 50 customers × $500/month avg = $300K
Year 3: 200 customers × $500/month avg = $1.2M
```

**Timeline: 6-12 months to launch**
